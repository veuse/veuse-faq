<h3>Gallery Posts</h3>

Create a new post and add a title and description.

Write your content and add whatever styling you want.

Click the Upload/Insert Media button. Once the window pops-up, drag your images onto the uploader and WordPress will upload them.

When the images are done uploading, you can drag and drop them in the order you'd like them to appear in your gallery. Save all changes when you're done.

The post will use any images you have attached for the gallery images. I suggest keeping your image width at 690px and keeping your images proportional as to not look like shit.

<h3>Video posts</h3>

Next, scroll down the page a bit and look for the Custom Fields box. If you don't see the Custom Fields box, look up towards the top of your screen and click the Screen Options drop down. Make sure Custom Fields is checked..

Now you can add the Custom Field. The Name is going to be okvideo and the value will be your embed code. The embed code should look something like the code below. Be sure to keep your video width around 690px to fit nicely in the theme. Click Add Custom Field.

<code><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/4143170?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" frameborder="0" width="565" height="229"></iframe></code>

Once you've added the custom field, you need to be sure to add a category or any descriptive tags if you want.
